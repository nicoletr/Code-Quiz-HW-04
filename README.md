Homework Week 4 - Code Quiz

This page is a quiz for the user to test their knowledge on code. <br>
They are presented with a start button, which when clicked will begin the quiz. <br>
The quiz will end if the timer runs out, or if the user answers all the questions <br>
Once the quiz has ended, the user can see their score on the highscores page. <br>
Their score will be ranked in order of highest to lowest among other scores.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this week I was very short on time due to a family issue. I wanted to submit my code even though unfinished, so I can receive feedback and continue to work on it to resubmit at a later time.<br>
